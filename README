# iNaturalist Order / Family Counter

# Version 1.1

# By Alan Rockefeller - March 17, 2025

## Overview

inat.orders.py is a command-line utility designed to help researchers extract taxonomic information for observations from iNaturalist. This information is useful when applying for a transportation permit to get specimens into a herbarium in Ecuador, and for summarizing information from iNaturalist observations for scientific papers.  It retrieves the taxonomic order and family (optional) for given observation IDs, while implementing responsible API access with rate limiting and retry logic.

It can also do a similar analysis on the usernames associated with iNaturalist observations - this is designed to be able to make a list of people to thank for sending in samples.

## Sample output

This is the output I generated using this code - it is going to be included in a new paper by the Ohio Mushroom DNA Lab.

I made it by running:  

alan@Dell-9700 ~/inat.orders.py (test)> python3 inat.orders.py --family (over 300 of iNaturalist numbers here) > obs.with.families.out.txt


## Features

- **Taxonomic Information Retrieval**: Extract order and family information from iNaturalist observation IDs
- **Large runs are ok!**: Even large numbers of iNaturalist numbers can be processed into reports with this code
- **Smart Rate Limiting / Retries**: Respects iNaturalist API rate limits to prevent request throttling
- **Hierarchical Summaries**: Provides summaries of orders and optionally families within orders when processing multiple observations
- **Flexible Output Options**: Customize the level of taxonomic detail and debugging information
- **Count users**: Record who is making these observations
- **File input**: Can take input iNaturalist observation numbers on the command line, or in a file (one observation per line)


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inat.orders.py.git
   cd inat.orders.py
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To look up the order for a single iNaturalist observation:

```bash
python3 inat.orders.py 135240378
```

For multiple observations, with family information

```bash
python3 inat.orders.py --family 262201758 262274361 261937401 261862641 262201653
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `observation_ids` | One or more iNaturalist observation IDs (required) |
| `--family` | Include family taxonomic rank in the output and summaries |
| `--delay DELAY` | Minimum delay in seconds between API calls (default: 1.0) |
| `--count-api-calls` | Print the total number of API calls made |
| `--debug` | Enable debug output for rate limiting and API calls |

## Output Format

### Single Observation (Order Only)
```
135240378: Agaricales
```

### Single Observation (With Family)
```
135240378: Order: Agaricales Family: Hymenogastraceae
```

### Multiple Observations (With Order Summary)
```
135240378: Agaricales
23456789: Russulales
34567890: Agaricales

Summary by Order:
     2  Agaricales
     1  Russulales
```

### Multiple Observations (With Order and Family Summaries)
```
12345678: Order: Agaricales Family: Amanitaceae
23456789: Order: Russulales Family: Russulaceae
34567890: Order: Agaricales Family: Psathyrellaceae

Summary by Order:
     2  Agaricales
     1  Russulales

Families within Agaricales:
     1  Amanitaceae
     1  Psathyrellaceae

Families within Russulales:
     1  Russulaceae
```

## How It Works

1. **API Request Management**: The `RateLimiter` class ensures that requests to the iNaturalist API respect rate limits by enforcing a minimum delay between consecutive requests.

2. **Taxonomic Information Retrieval**: For each observation ID:
   - The tool first requests basic observation data from the iNaturalist API
   - It extracts the taxon information from the response
   - If the taxon is not already at the order level (or family level when requested), it traverses the ancestry chain to find the appropriate taxonomic ranks
   - For efficiency, it makes additional API calls only when necessary to retrieve missing taxonomic information

3. **Summary Generation**: When processing multiple observations:
   - The tool counts occurrences of each order
   - When the `--family` flag is provided, it also organizes families within their respective orders
   - The summary is sorted by frequency (most common first)
   - Unknown or error cases are tracked separately

## Advanced Usage

### Processing Observation IDs from a File

You can process a list of observation IDs from a file using shell input redirection:

```bash
python inat_orders.py $(cat observation_ids.txt) --family
```

Or using `xargs`:

```bash
cat observation_ids.txt | xargs python inat_orders.py --family
```

### Redirecting Output to a File

Save the output to a file:

```bash
python inat.orders.py 12345678 23456789 34567890 --family > taxonomy_report.txt
```

### Error Handling

When taxonomic information cannot be retrieved, the tool provides informative error messages:

```
12345678: Error - No results found
23456789: Class: Magnoliopsida
34567890: Error - API request failed: 404 Client Error: Not Found
```

Errors will show up in summaries as unknown - this isnt necessarily an error, as some iNaturalist observations are already at order level, so don't have a family - or some genera aren't in any known family (incertae sedis) so there is no family information to get.

## API Rate Limits and Responsible Usage

This tool is designed to be respectful of iNaturalist's API rate limits. By default, it waits 1 second between API calls, which should be sufficient for most use cases. For larger batch processing, consider increasing the delay using the `--delay` parameter.

iNaturalist's API documentation states that:
- You should not make more than 100 requests per minute
- You should respect HTTP 429 responses by backing off (this tool implements exponential backoff)
